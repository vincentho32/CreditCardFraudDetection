## Background

The goal of this project is to generate fake portraits by creating a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and using a dataset of approximately 5800 real Portraits and Self-Portraits from between 1850 and 1950, which has been scraped from WikiArt by this [Kaggle user](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deewakarchakraborty/portrait-paintings). The results presented above were obtained after training the GAN for 200 epochs.
